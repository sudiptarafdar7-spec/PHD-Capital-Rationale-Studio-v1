# YouTube Cookies Setup Guide

## Why Do I Need This?

YouTube uses bot detection to block video downloads from VPS and cloud servers. This is why you see errors like:

```
ERROR: [youtube] Sign in to confirm you're not a bot
```

**Solution:** Upload your browser cookies so the system can download videos as if you're signed in to YouTube, bypassing the bot detection.

**Solution:** Simply export and upload fresh cookies following the same steps above.

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid file type" error

**Solution:** Make sure you're uploading a `.txt` file, not `.json` or other format. The file must be in Netscape cookie format.

### Problem: Downloads still failing after upload

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you were **signed in** to YouTube when exporting cookies
2. Try exporting fresh cookies (sign out and sign in again)
3. Check that the cookies file is not empty (should be 10-50 KB)
4. Try a different browser extension

### Problem: "Cookies file not found" in logs

**Solution:** Re-upload the cookies file through the API Keys page.

### Problem: Extension not working

**Alternative Method - Manual Export:**
1. Open YouTube in your browser while signed in
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
4. Click **Cookies** ‚Üí **https://www.youtube.com**
5. Right-click in the cookies table ‚Üí **Export all** (if available)
6. Or use a different extension like "EditThisCookie"

## üîß Technical Details (Advanced)

### Cookie File Format

The cookies.txt file uses Netscape cookie format:
```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
.youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1234567890	CONSENT	YES+...
.youtube.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1234567890	VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE	...
```

### How It Works

1. System checks for `backend/youtube_cookies.txt` file
2. If exists, passes file to `yt-dlp` with `--cookies` parameter
3. yt-dlp uses cookies to authenticate with YouTube
4. Downloads proceed as if user is signed in
5. Bot detection bypassed ‚úÖ

### Server Path

The cookies file is stored at:
```
/var/www/rationale-studio/backend/youtube_cookies.txt
```

Only root and the application user can read this file.
