Disclosure on Back-Testing</b></font><br/> <br/><b>Back-testing</b> is the application of a quantitative model to historical market data to generate hypothetical performance over a prior period. Use of back-tested data has inherent limitations, including:<br/> <br/> \u2022 Results do not reflect actual trading outcomes or the impact of material economic and market conditions on the decision-making process. They are achieved retrospectively and may benefit from hindsight.<br/> \u2022 Calculation of back-tested performance is based on assumptions integral to the model, which may or may not be testable, and therefore carry risk of losses.<br/> \u2022 Actual performance may differ significantly from back-tested results. Back-tested results are not adjusted for the reinvestment of dividends or other income and, unless stated otherwise, do not include transaction costs.<br/> \u2022 Back-tested returns do not represent actual returns and should not be interpreted as an indication of such.<br/> <br/> <br/><font size="14"><b>2.
