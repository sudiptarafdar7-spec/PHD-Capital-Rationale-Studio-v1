## 🚀 Push to GitHub Commands

Run these commands in your **Replit Shell**:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Production-ready deployment: Fixed critical bugs, removed sensitive files, added comprehensive VPS deployment scripts"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: After Pushing

### 1. Revoke Leaked Google Cloud Credentials

The file `backend/api_keys/google-cloud.json` was committed to git previously. You MUST:

1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Find the service account from the leaked file
3. **REVOKE/DELETE** that service account immediately
4. Create a NEW service account with fresh credentials
5. Add the NEW credentials via environment variables on VPS

**This is critical for security!**

---

## 🎯 Next Step: Deploy to VPS

After pushing to GitHub, deploy to your Hostinger VPS:

```bash
# SSH to your VPS
ssh root@72.60.111.9

# Download deployment script
curl -o deploy.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudiptarafdar7-spec/Rationale-Studio/main/deploy/PRODUCTION-DEPLOY.sh

# Run deployment
chmod +x deploy.sh
bash deploy.sh
```

**Then follow post-deployment steps:**
1. Add API keys to `/var/www/phd-capital/.env`
2. Configure DNS (A records → 72.60.111.9)
3. Install SSL certificate with certbot
4. Change admin password
