# PHD Capital Rationale Studio

## Overview
PHD Capital Rationale Studio is a full-stack web application designed to automate the generation of professional financial rationale reports from YouTube videos. Its primary purpose is to streamline the creation of detailed financial reports by leveraging multimedia content for insightful market analysis. The project aims to improve efficiency in financial reporting and supports the business vision of transforming video content into structured financial insights.

## User Preferences
- Keep frontend design unchanged (layout, forms, fields, animations, effects, flow)
- Use Flask for backend REST API
- Use PostgreSQL for database
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Role-based access control (admin/employee)

## System Architecture
The application features a clear separation between frontend and backend, built for robust financial analysis and reporting.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite.
- **UI/UX**: Radix UI for accessibility and Tailwind CSS for a modern, consistent design.
- **State Management**: React Context API.
- **Structure**: Reusable components and page-specific structures.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python 3.11) providing a REST API.
- **Authentication**: Flask-JWT-Extended for JWTs and bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon).
- **CORS**: Flask-CORS configured.
- **Core Features**:
    - **User Management**: CRUD operations with Admin/Employee roles.
    - **API Keys Management**: Secure storage for external service keys.
    - **PDF Template Management**: Configuration for standardized PDF reports.
    - **File Uploads**: Management of master CSVs, logos, and custom fonts.
    - **Channel Management**: CRUD operations for YouTube channels, including logo uploads.
    - **Media Rationale Pipeline**: A 14-step processing pipeline for YouTube videos, covering extraction, transcription, translation, analysis, and report generation, integrating various external services.
- **System Design Choices**:
    - **Modular API**: Endpoints organized by feature.
    - **Pipeline-driven Processing**: Sequential 14-step video analysis.
    - **Database Schema**: Dedicated tables for `users`, `api_keys`, `pdf_template`, `uploaded_files`, `channels`, `jobs`, `job_steps`, `saved_rationale`, and `activity_logs`.
    - **File Storage**: Secure server-side storage with UUID-based filenames.
    - **Deployment**: Optimized for VPS environments with robust deployment scripts to handle heavy background processing and large dependencies.

## Recent Changes (October 23, 2025)
- **DEPLOYMENT FIX**: Fixed systemd error 203/EXEC by removing space from directory name. Changed from "Rationale Studio" to "rationale-studio" to fix path parsing issue in systemd service file. Updated all deployment scripts and documentation.
- **FRESH DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION CREATED**: Built comprehensive deployment system understanding database-based API key management. Created deployment/ folder with: deploy.sh (one-command VPS setup), update.sh (easy updates), DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md (complete Windows PowerShell SSH guide with step-by-step instructions), and README.md (quick reference). System uses PostgreSQL for API key storage (managed via admin panel). Fixed database.py bug (fetchone() null check). Cleaned up repository (removed build/, old deploy/, attached_assets/). Updated .gitignore properly. Ready for GitHub push to: https://github.com/sudiptarafdar7-spec/PHD-Capital-Rationale-Studio-v1.git and Hostinger VPS deployment (IP: 72.60.111.9, Domain: researchrationale.in, Folder: "rationale-studio").
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXES**: Fixed SavedRationalePage.tsx sonner import, removed leaked Google Cloud credentials, fixed potential null reference in database.py line 87, cleaned up temporary files, updated .gitignore.
