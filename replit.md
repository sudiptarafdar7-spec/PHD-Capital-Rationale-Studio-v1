# PHD Capital Rationale Studio

## Overview
PHD Capital Rationale Studio is a full-stack web application designed to automate the generation of professional financial rationale reports from YouTube videos. Its primary purpose is to streamline the creation of detailed financial reports by leveraging multimedia content for insightful market analysis. The project aims to improve efficiency in financial reporting and supports the business vision of transforming video content into structured financial insights.

## User Preferences
- Keep frontend design unchanged (layout, forms, fields, animations, effects, flow)
- Use Flask for backend REST API
- Use PostgreSQL for database
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Role-based access control (admin/employee)

## System Architecture
The application features a clear separation between frontend and backend, built for robust financial analysis and reporting.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite.
- **UI/UX**: Radix UI for accessibility and Tailwind CSS for a modern, consistent design.
- **State Management**: React Context API.
- **Structure**: Reusable components and page-specific structures.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python 3.11) providing a REST API.
- **Authentication**: Flask-JWT-Extended for JWTs and bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon).
- **CORS**: Flask-CORS configured.
- **Core Features**:
    - **User Management**: CRUD operations with Admin/Employee roles.
    - **API Keys Management**: Secure storage for external service keys.
    - **PDF Template Management**: Configuration for standardized PDF reports.
    - **File Uploads**: Management of master CSVs, logos, and custom fonts.
    - **Channel Management**: CRUD operations for YouTube channels, including logo uploads.
    - **Media Rationale Pipeline**: A 14-step processing pipeline for YouTube videos, covering extraction, transcription, translation, analysis, and report generation, integrating various external services.
- **System Design Choices**:
    - **Modular API**: Endpoints organized by feature.
    - **Pipeline-driven Processing**: Sequential 14-step video analysis.
    - **Database Schema**: Dedicated tables for `users`, `api_keys`, `pdf_template`, `uploaded_files`, `channels`, `jobs`, `job_steps`, `saved_rationale`, and `activity_logs`.
    - **File Storage**: Secure server-side storage with UUID-based filenames.
    - **Deployment**: Optimized for VPS environments with robust deployment scripts to handle heavy background processing and large dependencies.

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon)
- **Authentication**: Flask-JWT-Extended
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt
- **CORS Management**: Flask-CORS
- **Video Metadata**: YouTube Data API v3 (for fetching video metadata)
- **Video Download**: Apify YouTube Video Downloader API (for obtaining video download URLs)
- **Audio Processing**: ffmpeg (for audio extraction and conversion)
- **Video Processing**: `yt-dlp` (for downloading captions only)
- **Transcription**: AssemblyAI API
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy, isodate (for ISO 8601 duration parsing)
- **Translation**: Google Cloud Translation API
- **UI Icons**: Lucide React
- **AI Analysis**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o for speaker detection and analysis)
- **Financial Data**: Dhan API
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL)
- **HTTP Requests**: requests library

## Recent Changes

### October 26, 2025
- **APIFY MIGRATION (STEP 1 - DOWNLOAD AUDIO)**: Completed migration from yt-dlp to Apify YouTube Video Downloader API for audio downloading. Changes include:
  - Added Apify API field to API Keys page (frontend) for secure key management
  - Updated `step01_download_audio.py` to use Apify for obtaining video download URLs
  - Implemented ffmpeg-based audio extraction that handles HLS/M3U8 streams directly
  - Maintains backward compatibility: raw_audio.wav as 44.1kHz PCM WAV, prepared_audio.wav as 16kHz mono WAV
  - Granular error handling for Apify failures, URL expiry, download issues, and conversion failures
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary files on both success and failure scenarios
  - Two-step audio process matches original yt-dlp behavior: download/extract â†’ convert to 16kHz mono
  - Installed `apify-client` Python package for Apify API integration
  - Note: yt-dlp is now only used for downloading captions (Step 2)

### October 25, 2025
- **YOUTUBE DATA API v3 MIGRATION**: Migrated video metadata fetching from yt-dlp to YouTube Data API v3 for improved reliability and performance. Changes include:
  - Added YouTube Data API v3 field to API Keys page (frontend)
  - Updated `fetch_video_data.py` to use YouTube Data API v3 instead of yt-dlp for metadata extraction
  - Installed `isodate` Python package for parsing ISO 8601 duration format
  - API key is securely stored in the database and retrieved during video metadata fetching
  - All metadata fields preserved (video_id, title, channel_name, upload_date, upload_time, duration, thumbnail, description)
  - Timezone conversion from UTC to IST maintained
  - Proper error handling for missing API keys, invalid URLs, and API failures

### October 23, 2025
- **BULLETPROOF DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION CREATED**: Completely rebuilt deployment system from scratch to handle all production issues. New deployment/ folder includes: deploy.sh (fully automated one-command VPS setup with Python 3.11, all system dependencies, automatic admin user creation), update.sh (one-command updates from git), DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md (comprehensive Windows PowerShell SSH guide), and README.md (quick command reference). Deployment script now: installs Python 3.11 from deadsnakes PPA, installs libpq-dev and postgresql-server-dev-all for psycopg2, exports environment variables for seed script to fix database connection, automatically runs seed script to create admin user, generates secure environment keys, sets up systemd service and Nginx reverse proxy. Tested frontend build successfully (14s, 2552 modules). Ready for production deployment to Hostinger VPS (IP: 72.60.111.9, Domain: researchrationale.in, Path: /var/www/rationale-studio).
- **DEPLOYMENT FIX**: Fixed systemd error 203/EXEC by removing space from directory name. Changed from "Rationale Studio" to "rationale-studio" throughout codebase.
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXES**: Fixed SavedRationalePage.tsx sonner import, removed leaked Google Cloud credentials, fixed potential null reference in database.py line 87, cleaned up temporary files, updated .gitignore.
